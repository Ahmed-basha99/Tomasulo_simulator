The project is am implemetation of tomasulu algorithim. 
It aims to simulate the behaviour and steps done by tomasulu algorithim, as you can see the reservation station, and register file in the simulation.
You need to load the program first and then press run to run it cycle by cycle.
By pressing the next button, you can observe what happens in the next clock cycle. 
The supported instructions are :
ADD rd, rs1, rs2 
ADDI rd, rs1, imm,  
NOR rd, rs1, rs2, 
NEG rd, rs1
LOAD rd, imm(rs1), 
STORE rs1, imm(rs2),  
MUL rd,rs1,rs2,
There are only 8 general purporse register, with r0 have the value zero, and it cant be rewritten or renamed.
You need to have npm, react, and typescript installed to run the website as it is not deplyed yet.
to run the program, cd to the root direcotry of the project, and type npm start.
There is a sample test that you can run.
